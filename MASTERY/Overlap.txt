SMART CONTRACTS:: Are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary ..

FInd more on:: Oracle problem and oracle decentralization
Note that most blockchains are compatible with ethereum

WEB1.0:: permissionless open sourced web with static content
WEB2.0:: permissioned web with dynamic content, where companies run your agreements on their servers
WEB3.0:: permissionless web with dynamic content where decentralized networks run your agreement.. it is generally accompanied by user owned ecosystems.. #uses own protocols

A SMART CONTRACT is an agreement or contract or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain..

Advgs of SMART CONTRACTS
-------------------------
-decentralized
-counterparty risk removal
-cannot mererly be hacked
-security immutability
-speed and effecient
-transparent and flexibility
-trust minimized agreements

ACCRONYMS
---------------
DEFI: DEcentralized FInance
DAOS::DEcentralized Autonomous Organisations.
NFTS::Non-fungible Tokens.

ABOUT GAS
-----------
The more complex your blockchain is, the more gas you are charged and vice versa
The more pple send transactions at the same time, the more gas costs are .
NOte that it is possible to set the limit of the gas that you want to spend across your transactions..
Base fee:: The minimum gas price to send your transaction.
Gas fee is paid by anyone that initialise a transaction.

TRANSACTION FEE = GAS PRICE * GAS USED

A HASH:: A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. created by placing said data into a hash function

BLOCKS
----------
GENESIS BLOCK::This is the first block in a blockchain

-A hashing algorithm is a function that computes data into a unique hash..
-Mining is the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
NOdes get paid for mining blocks .
-NODE refers to a single instance in a decentralized network.

-A block is a list of transactions mined together.
-Nonce is the 'Number used Once' to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
-It is also used to define the transaction Number for an account / address.

NOte that a private key is only known to the key holder, it is used to sign transactions

NOTE::
Public key is derived from your private key..Any one can see it to verify that a transaction came from you.

QUICK EXPLANATION
private key ||| > Public key > address

secrete behind hashing
---------------------
<secrete-key> + account-Number

BLOCKCHAIN ATTACKS
-Sybil Attacks :: when a user create anonymous accounts to increment a network.
-51% Attacks :: find more about this..
it is not easy to do PoW and PoS..
PoW is so fantastic thoo it requires a lot of electricity

**PoS nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism
In this Stake, the miners are validators and nolonger miners..
It uses less amount of energy.. it is very decentralized and more secure..

NOTE::
PoS and PoW are sybil resistance mechanism..
the bigger the blockchain, the more secure..
Consensus is how the blockchains decide what the state of the chain is..
Sharding and rollups are scallability solutions..
ONLY, so many transactions can fit in a block..
Gas prices are how much it costs to perform executions on-chain..

 when we use memory and calldata it means that a variable will exist for a short time: function call .
a memory variable can be modeified while a calldata variable cannot be modeified .

WIth overridden functions, it is unresolved error with my solidity compiler which i have to resolve as soon as possible..
with `new` keyword , we can deploy many contracts from other contracts..
it is a good practice to use the destructuring form of importing contracts from files.. you look really good dev..
With inheritance, to overrid a function, we need to add `Virtual` keyword to the parent function and override to the derived function..

----------------------
REVERTS
--------
=> They undo any actions that have been done, and send the remaining gas back..
    with above example, if the amount of eth is less than requires, the transaction does revert 

TRANSACTIONS -- value Transfer
  -Nonce
  -Gas price
  -Gas limit
  -To
  -Value 
  -Data 
  V,r,s ::Components of tx signature

  NOTE::
  A blockchain oracle is any device that interacts eith off-chain world to provide with external data or computation to smart contracts..
  centralized oracle are a point of failure. instead use decentralized oracles like: Chainlink

  CHAINLINK FEATURES
  ------------------
   -Chainlink data feeds
   -Chainlink VRF:: Chainlink Verifyable Randomness Function 
   -Chainlink Keepers(reanamed to Chainlink automation)::decentralized event driven features 
   -End-To-End Reliability::The Promise of Smart Contracts..

   NOTE:: READ THE FULL DOCUMENTATION OF CHAINLINK..
INorder for a function to receive any remarkable amount of ethereum, we need to mark it as payable..
Interfaces help us to make api calls..


*CONSTRUCTORS are used to provide only user the full ability to use a specific function in a contract to avoid unauthorized access::
eg function withdraw() {} ::  CONSTRUCTORS help to avoid another user to use that function for an authorized actions..

FIND MORE ON MODIIFERS::THE USE OF UNDERSCORE(positions)

NOTE::With constant and immutable variables, less gas is used compared to non-constant variables..
  -immutable variables are the variables that are declared and updated Once and use less gas
     eg:: address[] public immutable i_owner;
NOte::To optimize more gas , we can also use the custom error handling

::Some code is not working, make sure to find the cause..

WITH receive() and fallback() STRUCTURED EXAMPLE::

      :: speedrun.com

          Ether is sent to contract
      is msg.data empty ??
            /      \        
          yes      no
           /         \

  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
    -source/users/jaz/.bashrc  or follow what foundry tells you
    -foundryup

  TOOLS FOR BLOCKCHAIN DEV::
     -foundry
     -hardhat 

     To start a new project::
     ------------------------
       -enter in its directory
       -run :: forge init
      To compile foundry project::
      ----------------------------
       -forge build || forge compile

        Deploying the project like on ganache ::
        -----------------------
         run `anvil`  to see contract info ::addresses, private keys etc 

NOTE that it is not advised to paste in the vscode terminal the private key, since fundsc may be lost..
instead use the private keys from fake accounts of `ganache` or `anvil`..

 Then, you can use `history -c` to remove this history from the shell to avoid it to being seen by anyone..

     WHILE USING script method to deploy a contract, we moe to the script folder and create a `deploy.s.sol` file that is used to deploy contracts using scripte..
     Don't forget to copy SimpleStorage.sol from the initial part of the project(Mastery) to the src folder in the roo directory..

     NOte that the cheatcodes used in this foundry project are only applicable in foundry projects ..
         ::Nonce increments every single time you send a transaction..

     For development purposes, it is advisable to use a .env file where you put your sensitive information to avoid other people from accessing it ..
     But note that it is only advisable for dev't purposes not actual transactions for real Contracts
     The .env file is created in test directory.. and configured in .gitignore to avoid it from being pushed ..
     -------------------------
     .env configuration::
     PRIVATE_KEY = ---
     RPC_URL = ---
     SEPOLIAPC_URL = ---
     -------------------------
     After, run :: source .env
                :: echo $PRIVATE_KEY
                :: echo $RPC_URL

    And the you can use the keywords defined in .env to deploy scripts as::
     `forge script script/DeploySimpleStorage.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --broadcast --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY`

-------------
using a keystore:: it is a file that has your private key incrypted with your password to add more security..
------------

In readme.md::
   1.For the moment, a `PRIVATE_KEY` in my `.env` file.
   1. So long as I don't expose the `.env` file.
   2. But for real money, I won't do it . I will use `--interactive` or a keystore file with a password once foundry adds that..
