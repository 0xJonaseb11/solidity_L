SMART CONTRACTS:: Are a set of instructions executed in a decentralized way without the need for a centralized or third party intermediary ..

Note that most blockchains are compatible with ethereum
 
WEB1.0:: permissionless open sourced web with static content
WEB2.0:: permissioned web with dynamic content, where companies run your agreements on their servers
WEB3.0:: permissionless web with dynamic content where decentralized networks run your agreement.. it is generally accompanied by user owned ecosystems.. #uses own protocols

A SMART CONTRACT is  an agreement or contract  or set of instructions that is deployed on a decentralized blockchain..
   
   Advgs of SMART CONTRACTS
   -------------------------
   -decentralized
   -counterparty  risk removal
   -cannot mererly be hacked
   -security immutability
   -speed and effecient
   -transparent and flexibility
   -trust minimized agreements

                   ABOUT GAS
                   -----------
                   The more complex your blockchain is, the more gas you are charged and vice versa
                   The more pple send transactions at the same time, the more gas costs are .
                NOte that it is possible to set the limit of the gas that you want to spend across your transactions..
             Base fee:: The minimum gas price to send your transaction.
            Gas fee is paid by anyone that initialise a transaction.

TRANSACTION FEE = GAS PRICE * GAS USED

A HASH:: A unique fixed length string, meant to identify a piece of data. created by placing said data into a hash function

                      BLOCKS
                    ----------
                    GENESIS BLOCK::This is the first block in a blockchain

                     -A hashing algorithm is a function that computes data into a unique hash..
                     -Mining is the process of finding the solution to the blockchain problem.
                    NOdes get paid for mining blocks .
                     -NODE refers to a single instance in a decentralized network.

                     -A block is a list of transactions mined together.
                     -Nonce is the 'Number used Once' to find the solution to the blockchain problem.
                    -It is also used to define the transaction Number for an account / address.

                    NOte that a private key is only known to the key holder, it is used to sign transactions

                    NOTE::
                    Public key is derived from your private key..Any one can see it to verify that a transaction came from you.
                      
                      QUICK EXPLANATION
                      private key ||| > Public key > address

                     it is not easy to do PoW and PoS..
                     PoW is so fantastic thoo it requires a lot of electricity

**PoS nodes put up collateral as a sybil resistance mechanism
 In this Stake, the miners are validators and nolonger miners..
It uses less amount of energy.. it is very decentralized and more secure..

NOTE::
PoS and PoW are sybil resistance mechanism.. 
the bigger the blockchain, the more secure..
Consensus is how the blockchains decide what the state of the chain is..
Sharding and rollups are scallability solutions..
ONLY, so many transactions can fit in a block..
Gas prices are how much it costs to perform executions on-chain..
